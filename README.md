### Movie Ticketing System using Java-Sprint Boot
> ### Final Project Assignment For Jave Enterprise

```
This is a Movie-Ticket Java web application using Spring Boot, this web application
will allow users “with or without an account” to buy tickets, the application also can
give a discount for registered users or those who fall in some categories, such as
Sheridan College student, PRPG32758 student, Senior Citizens, and Children

Each user can buy many tickets, and the program will display each ticket
separately, the user can also see all tickets bought according to the name on the
movie ticket. The application will store each ticket on a separate file in
(“C:\receipts”) directory. Each file will be distinguished by different factors
(filename+number+ticketname+moviename+dateOfpruchase).
Tickets can only be sold one for a movie at a certain seat and time, otherwise, the
program will show an error.
This application is not only simple to use and has a beautiful user interface but also
contains many features like HTTP Sessions, security, interacting with databases,
and features to access databases and perform CRUD operations only for the admin.
